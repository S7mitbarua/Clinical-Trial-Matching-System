# Clinical Trial Matching System

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

## Overview

The Clinical Trial Matching System is a tool designed to match patients with relevant clinical trials based on their health conditions and profiles. The system incorporates natural language processing (NLP) techniques to match patient eligibility criteria with clinical trial descriptions.

## Features

- Patient profiling: Create profiles for patients, including details such as age, health conditions, and hospital affiliation.
- Clinical trial data: Simulated data for clinical trials, including trial titles and eligibility criteria.
- Natural Language Processing: Utilize NLP techniques to match patient profiles with relevant clinical trials.
- Simulated Patient and Trial Data: Easily replace simulated data with real data for practical use.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Usage

1. Simulate Data:
   - Run the provided notebooks or scripts to simulate patient, hospital, and clinical trial data.

2. Match Patients with Trials:
   - Update the patient profile in the example script (`example_script.py`) and run it to see matching trials.

3. Replace Simulated Data (Optional):
   - Replace the simulated data with real patient, hospital, and clinical trial data for live use.
